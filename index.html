<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In what could be termed as a significant development for residents, the number of Covid-19 cases and casualties have gone down significantly during the latter part of the month.The district reported a total of 2,039 positive cases and 108 deaths due to the disease during the month of June. However, the number of daily positive cases came down to two digits after June 13 as the district witnessed an upturn.The district reported only 648 positive cases and 33 deaths after June 13 in comparison to 1,391 cases and 75 deaths in the first 12 days of the month.The district had reported a total of 12,194 positive cases and 495 deaths due to the disease in May. In April, it had reported a total of 11,498 positive cases and 286 casualties.The significant improvement has led residents as well as authorities to believe that the second Covid wave is receding. However, at the same time the Health Department and district administration has expressed concerns about the possible third wave of infections.A health official said: “During the month of June, there were four days, when the district did not report even a single death. Before that, the district had been reporting deaths due to the disease every day for more than three-and-a-half months. In regard to the number of deaths and daily reported cases, the situation has vastly improved.”</p>

 <h4>Punbus contractual workers call off strike</h4>

<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The Punbus Contractual Workers’ Union called off its strike on Wednesday and resumed working after the government called them for a meeting.Kuljit Singh, president, Punbus Contractual Workers’ Union, said the strike was called off after a meeting of the union with Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Transport Minister Razia Sultana was fixed in Chandigarh for July 1. He said the government assured to positively look into the demand of regularisation of nearly 7,500 contractual workers in the Punbus and PRTC.Sahildeep Singh of Fatehgarh Churriyan said the strike had once again brought private buses at the forefront. They had been relegated following the freebie of free travel to women passengers. He said there was no change of fare between government and private buses as the tariff of Rs35 was being charged from one person.Sudesh Kumar, a general merchant, said he frequently goes to remote and isolated rural areas to sell general merchandise. He said though the availability of buses came down, there was no overcharging by private buses. For example, he pays Rs30 per person for travel to Tarn Taran, a town which is 24 km from Amritsar. He said daily passengers shell out only Rs20 for the same distance. Shubham Tulli, a garment trader, said: “There were less number of buses available on different routes during the two-day strike, but at the same time enough passengers were also not available.” He added that he visited garment shops in almost all satellite towns, including, Baba Bakala, Ajnala, Rajasansi and Ramdas among others. Giving its reasons, he said people were avoiding travel due to Covid-19 infection and rising mercury. The opportunity to avail free travel facility in the state-run buses brought out only women passengers, who were not seen during the strike.</p>
